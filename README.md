# Arrate: Arjan's Rails templates

## Introduction

This gem overrides some commonly used Rails generator templates to better suit
what I would normally write.

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

    gem 'arrate'

## Usage

Use generators like you would normally. New templates provided by this gem will
be automatically picked up. Templates include:

* Scaffold controller
* Haml views
* RSpec controller specs

## Other

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
   unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
   ignore when I pull)
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
